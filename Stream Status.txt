Me Baby!!
Hey My People! Midnight EST I'm Going LIVE!! (on twitch): http://twitch.tv/jamie_337_nichols 
Tonight I'm starting to work on the front end of the GrabMovies App. I've been getting the framework made for the back-end of the app by wrapping TMDB's REST API with Graphql!! and its been a frustrating and rewarding experience. Now that I've got the base functionality worked out its time for me to start on some front end functionality. I'm thinking WEBTORRENT Movie Player!!!!. Lets see if we can use Graphql to get web torrents and stream them! 
Come hang out and watch me WIN BIG or FAIL HARD. Either way i'll try to engage and entertain.  Bring the popcorn and don't forget your 2 cents.
